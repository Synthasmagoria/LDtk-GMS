# Tips and tricks

## General assets sprite page
When you want your entities to have the same sprites as they do in the game you might be tempted to add a tileset for each sprite directly from your game's sprites folder.
My recommendation is to create a big image file that you add your object sprites to as you go.
Then you can just create a single LDtk tileset from that and refer to it in all/most of your entities.
